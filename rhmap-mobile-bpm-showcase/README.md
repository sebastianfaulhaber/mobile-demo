======================================================================

A. Synopsis
===========

What this is about
------------------
A lot has happened in the area of mobile since Apple kicked off the revolution by announcing the first iPhone. However, the overall mobile market still has to be considered as young and especially unstandardized. This really puts a lot of organizations in front of huge challenges concerning the efficient development of mobile applications and the secure integration into backend IT systems. - But there is no way around mobile in the next years! The smart combination of mobile techniques (mBaaS, micro services, etc.) and business process management approaches will definitely drive process efficiency and speed to a whole new level.
